Recover context and detect next action for the current working session.
User arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Current branch:
!`git branch --show-current`

Recent history:
!`git log --oneline -5`

Default branch:
!`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' | grep . || echo main`

Changes from default branch:
!`git diff --shortstat $(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' | grep . || echo main)`

Working tree:
!`git status --short`

## Instructions

**Note**: Throughout this skill, `<default-branch>` denotes the repository's default branch, taken from the `Default branch:` value in the pre-computed context above (which resolves `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` and falls back to `main` when `origin/HEAD` is not set). Use this resolved value wherever the rules below mention `<default-branch>` — never hardcode `main`.

### 0. Argument Parsing

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a phase name (investigate, plan, implement, test, review, or commit), skip directly to **Step 4** and use the specified phase for guidance.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, proceed with full recovery (Steps 1-pre and 1-4).

### 1-pre. phase-state.yaml primary state read

`phase-state.yaml` is the **primary** source of truth for ticket lifecycle state, read **before** the compact-state / session-log sources in Step 1. See `skills/create-ticket/references/phase-state-schema.md` for the canonical schema.

Use the `Glob` tool to enumerate state files across **both** ticket locations. Patterns are **depth-agnostic** so both the legacy flat layout (`.backlog/active/{NNN}-{slug}/`) and the nested layouts (`.backlog/active/{parent-slug}/{NNN}-{slug}/`, or deeper) are discovered with a single Glob call per location:
- `.backlog/active/**/phase-state.yaml`
- `.backlog/product_backlog/**/phase-state.yaml`

After collecting matches, **deduplicate** by the resolved file path — if the same `phase-state.yaml` is returned by two Glob patterns (e.g. because a fallback pattern also fires), render it exactly once. Depth-agnostic globs plus the dedup step together guarantee that a triple-nested ticket (`.backlog/active/alpha/beta/003-deep/phase-state.yaml`) is listed once, not three times.

Product-backlog tickets sit at `last_completed_phase: create_ticket` with `overall_status: in-progress` — they are real in-progress records that Rule 0 must be able to recommend `/scout` for. Missing this location caused the pre-PR-E discovery gap (Reviewer B Findings 3, 4). For each match, use the `Read` tool to load the file, then use `Grep` on the in-memory content (via line-prefix matching — NOT shell pipelines; the allowed-tools of this skill do not include shell piping, consistent with AC 4.7) to extract per-ticket records:

- `current_phase` (top-level scalar: `create_ticket | scout | impl | ship | done`)
- `last_completed_phase` (top-level scalar: `create_ticket | scout | impl | ship | null`)
- `overall_status` (top-level scalar: `in-progress | blocked | done | failed`)
- `created` (top-level ISO-8601 scalar)
- For each phase section under `phases:` where present, its `started_at` scalar (used to resolve the "most recent" tie-break in Rule 0 — formerly Rule 0.5 before the precedence flip in Task 7)

Match only **top-level** scalars for `current_phase`, `last_completed_phase`, `overall_status` (lines whose content starts at column 0). Do not confuse them with identically-named nested keys under `phases:` which are indented.

Build an ordered per-ticket record list `phase_state_records = [{dir, location, current_phase, last_completed_phase, overall_status, created, latest_started_at}, ...]`. The `location` field is `active` when the file path matches `.backlog/active/` and `product_backlog` when it matches `.backlog/product_backlog/` — Rule 0's `{ticket-dir}` output includes the full prefix (e.g. `.backlog/product_backlog/001-foo`) so the recommended command resolves correctly without the user having to guess the location. The `latest_started_at` field is the maximum `phases.{phase}.started_at` across that ticket's phase sections; when no `started_at` is present, fall back to `created`. Carry this list forward to Steps 2, 4, and 5.

**Freshness flag**: If `phase_state_records` is non-empty (i.e. the `Glob` above found at least one valid `phase-state.yaml`), set `phase_state_fresh = true`; otherwise `phase_state_fresh = false`. The flag is consumed in Step 2 to decide whether to skip the researcher subagent — when the unified state file is present it already carries the per-phase records forward, so there is nothing a deep research pass would add. This simpler rule (presence, not mtime) replaces the prior 1-hour mtime check; it removes the need for the `Bash(stat:*)` permission without weakening the researcher-skip guarantee, because every state-file update is accompanied by a CHECKPOINT emission that is already the strongest "recently touched" signal available in the catchup flow.

**Dual-state precedence check (autopilot-state.yaml)**: After building `phase_state_records`, additionally `Glob` for `autopilot-state.yaml` under `.backlog/briefs/active/**/` and `.backlog/active/**/` (depth-agnostic — nested parent-slug layouts are common). For each hit, apply the precedence rule documented in `skills/create-ticket/references/phase-state-schema.md` §5 ("Dual-state precedence"):

- During `/autopilot` execution, `autopilot-state.yaml` is authoritative for pipeline orchestration; `phase-state.yaml` is maintained in parallel.
- Outside autopilot, `phase-state.yaml` is authoritative.

Concretely, when both `autopilot-state.yaml` and `phase-state.yaml` exist for the same ticket, prefer `autopilot-state.yaml` when the ticket is under `.backlog/briefs/active/` (i.e. an autopilot-managed brief currently being orchestrated); otherwise prefer `phase-state.yaml`. This drops the prior mtime-based tiebreak (and the `Bash(stat:*)` permission that enabled it) but preserves the important rule: autopilot-driven tickets defer to `autopilot-state.yaml` because it is the orchestration source-of-truth while the pipeline is running.

When `autopilot-state.yaml` wins precedence, annotate the corresponding record (or add a new record when no `phase-state.yaml` exists for that ticket) with `source: autopilot-state` and prefer it for Rule 0 guidance. Emit a warning line `autopilot-state.yaml is authoritative for {ticket-dir} (autopilot-managed brief); deferring to autopilot-state per dual-state precedence.` The full fold-in of `autopilot-state.yaml` into `phase-state.yaml` is deferred — see `skills/create-ticket/references/autopilot-foldin.md`.

**If no `phase-state.yaml` file exists anywhere in `.backlog/active/` OR `.backlog/product_backlog/`**, set `phase_state_records = []` and fall through to Step 1 unchanged (AC 4.5 — existing compact-state + artifact-discovery behavior is preserved).

### 1. Compact-State and Session-Log Recovery

Check for recent compact-state files in `.docs/compact-state/compact-state-*.md` (most recent first).

**If the latest file starts with a YAML frontmatter (`---`)**, parse the frontmatter and extract the following fields as variables (used in Step 4):
- `date` — when the compact happened
- `branch` — branch at compact time
- `active_tickets` — list of ticket directories that were active
- `active_plans` — list of plan files that were active
- `latest_eval_round` — highest round number across all tickets (aggregate)
- `latest_audit_round` — highest round number across all tickets (aggregate)
- `last_round_outcome` — `PASS` | `FAIL` | `PASS_WITH_CONCERNS` | `unknown` (aggregate — from the most relevant impl-loop ticket)
- `in_progress_phase` — `impl-loop` | `impl-done` | `unknown` (aggregate — `impl-loop` if any ticket is looping)
- `tickets` — per-ticket array with `{dir, latest_eval_round, latest_audit_round, last_round_outcome, in_progress_phase}` for each active ticket

Use the `Read` tool to load the full compact-state file into context, then extract scalar fields by matching line prefixes (e.g., `latest_eval_round:`, `in_progress_phase:`). For list fields (`active_tickets`, `active_plans`) collect lines matching `^  - ` (2-space indent, dash, space) until the next non-list line. For the per-ticket `tickets:` array, each ticket entry begins with `  - dir: ` and its attributes are indented by 4 spaces (`    latest_eval_round:`, `    latest_audit_round:`, `    last_round_outcome:`, `    in_progress_phase:`). Parse them as an ordered list of maps; each map terminates when the next `  - dir: ` line appears or when the block ends. Do NOT use Bash for parsing — the allowed-tools of this skill do not include shell piping; `Read` and `Grep` are sufficient.

**If the latest file does not start with `---`**, treat it as a legacy compact-state file and ignore the structured fields (still keep its existence as a flag for Step 2).

**If no compact-state file is found** (or as a complement), check for the most recent session log at `.docs/session-log/session-log-*.md`. If the file starts with a YAML frontmatter (`---`), parse the metadata (`date`, `branch`, `last_commit`, `changed_files`) and the `## Final Status` / `## Recent Commits` sections to recover the last-known working state. Skip files without YAML frontmatter (legacy format).

### 2. Context Analysis (conditional)

Determine whether the **researcher** agent is needed:

- **Skip researcher** if ALL of the following are true:
  - Current branch equals `<default-branch>` (the value resolved at the top of the Instructions section)
  - Working tree has 0 changed files
  - No compact-state file was found in Step 1
  (State is obvious — clean start, no prior work to recover.)

- **Skip researcher** if:
  - A compact-state file was found in Step 1 that is less than 1 hour old
  (State is already available from the file — no need for deep analysis.)

- **Skip researcher** if `phase_state_fresh = true` (set in Step 1-pre — at least one valid `phase-state.yaml` record exists). The unified state file already carries the per-phase records forward, so there is nothing a deep research pass would add (AC 4.6).

- **Otherwise**: Spawn the **researcher** agent to analyze:
  - What has changed on this branch vs `<default-branch>`
  - What the changes are trying to accomplish
  - Current state of work (complete, in-progress, blocked)
  - Check `.backlog/active/` for any active tickets and their artifacts (investigation.md, plan.md, eval-round-*.md)

### 3. Artifact Discovery

Check for existing docs (regardless of whether researcher was spawned):
- `.docs/plans/` — implementation plans
- `.docs/research/` — research findings
- `.backlog/active/` — active tickets and their artifacts
- `.docs/session-log/session-log-*.md` — most recent session log (if any) for last-known branch state

### 4. Phase Auto-Detection and Guidance

Detect the current development phase by checking these conditions **in order**. Check both `.docs/` and `.backlog/active/` for artifacts. Use the **first matching** phase.

**Rule precedence note**: `phase-state.yaml` is the authoritative lifecycle state source. Rule 0 below therefore evaluates `phase_state_records` (from Step 1-pre) **strictly before** the legacy compact-state rule (now Rule 0-legacy). The legacy rule only fires when Rule 0 did not match (typically on repositories that have no `phase-state.yaml` yet, or where every record has `overall_status != in-progress`).

0. **`phase-state.yaml` indicates an in-progress ticket with a completed phase** → suggest `next_recommended` command based on `last_completed_phase` mapping

   - **Precedence**: this rule is evaluated **strictly before Rule 0-legacy** and before Rule 1. `phase-state.yaml` is the authoritative state source; only when it yields no match do the legacy compact-state / artifact-discovery rules apply.
   - **Fire condition**: at least one record in `phase_state_records` (from Step 1-pre) has `overall_status: in-progress` AND `last_completed_phase != ship` AND `last_completed_phase != null`. If none match, fall through to Rule 0-legacy.
   - **Mapping from `last_completed_phase` to next recommended command**:

     | `last_completed_phase` | ticket location | next command |
     |---|---|---|
     | `create_ticket` | `.backlog/active/` or `.backlog/product_backlog/` | `/scout {ticket-dir}` |
     | `scout` | `.backlog/active/` | `/impl {plan-path}` |
     | `impl` | `.backlog/active/` | `/ship` |

     (`last_completed_phase == ship` means the ticket should have moved to `.backlog/done/`; skip.)

     The `{ticket-dir}` carries its full location prefix — for a product_backlog ticket use the full path (e.g. `.backlog/product_backlog/001-foo`), not just the bare directory name. Step 1-pre records the `location` field per record specifically so this mapping can emit the correct prefix.

   - **Single in-progress ticket**: recommend the mapped command using that ticket's `{ticket-dir}` (and `plan.md` path for the `scout → /impl` case).
   - **Multiple in-progress tickets** (AC 4.3): list ALL matching tickets in the guidance, then recommend resuming the one with the **most recent `latest_started_at`** (computed in Step 1-pre as the max `phases.{phase}.started_at` across that ticket's phase sections, with `created` as fallback). Ties are broken by lexicographic `{ticket-dir}` order. Name the selected ticket in the recommendation line so the user can see which one was chosen.

   - **Inconsistency warning (Rule 0 vs Rule 0-legacy)**: If Rule 0 fires AND a YAML-frontmatter compact-state was also parsed in Step 1 AND the compact-state's aggregate suggestion (from Rule 0-legacy below) would recommend a different action than Rule 0 AND `phase-state.yaml` mtime (from Step 1-pre) is newer than the compact-state's `date` field, emit a single warning line **before** the Rule 0 guidance:

     ```
     Inconsistency detected between phase-state.yaml and older compact-state. Preferring phase-state.yaml (newer).
     ```

     Then proceed with the Rule 0 recommendation. This surfaces — rather than silently hides — state drift between the two files, so users can investigate whether the compact-state snapshot is stale.

0-legacy. **Compact-state indicates an in-progress `/impl` loop** → suggest **resume `/impl`** *(only when Rule 0 did not fire)*
   - Check: a YAML-frontmatter compact-state file was parsed in Step 1 AND `in_progress_phase == impl-loop` (aggregate field)
   - Check: no new git commit has been made since the compact-state's `date` (compare against `git log -1 --format=%cI` for the most recent commit). If a newer commit exists, the user has already moved on — skip Rule 0-legacy and fall through to the rules below.
   - **Per-ticket guidance** (when `tickets:` array is present): identify ticket(s) with `in_progress_phase == impl-loop` from the per-ticket array. For each such ticket, include its directory, round number, and outcome in the guidance.
     - Single impl-loop ticket: "You were in the middle of `/impl` for `{dir}` (round `{latest_eval_round}` evaluated, last outcome: `{last_round_outcome}`). Re-run `/impl` to resume."
     - Multiple impl-loop tickets: List all looping tickets with their round/outcome, then recommend resuming the one with the highest `latest_eval_round`.
   - **Fallback** (when `tickets:` array is absent — legacy compact-state): use the aggregate `latest_eval_round` and `last_round_outcome` as before. If `active_tickets` is non-empty, name the ticket directory in the guidance.

1. **No research files for current topic** → suggest **investigate**
   - Check: `.docs/research/` is empty or has no files related to current branch
   - Also check: `.backlog/active/` has ticket directories but no `investigation.md` in any of them
   - Guidance: Use `/investigate <topic>`. If a ticket exists in `.backlog/active/`, mention its directory.

2. **Research exists, no plans** → suggest **plan**
   - Check: `.docs/research/` has files BUT `.docs/plans/` has no related files
   - Also check: `.backlog/active/**/investigation.md` exists BUT `.backlog/active/**/plan.md` does not (depth-agnostic; covers nested layouts)
   - Guidance: Read the research first, then use `/plan2doc <feature>`. `/plan2doc` automatically uses sonnet for S-size and opus for M/L/XL.

3. **Plans exist, no code diff from default branch** → suggest **implement**
   - Check: `.docs/plans/` has files BUT `git diff <default-branch> --name-only` shows no changes outside `.docs/` and `.backlog/`
   - Also check: `.backlog/active/**/plan.md` exists BUT no code changes outside `.backlog/` (depth-agnostic)
   - Guidance: Read the plan first, then use `/impl`.

4. **Code diff exists, no test changes** → suggest **test**
   - Check: `git diff <default-branch> --name-only` shows source changes BUT no test file changes
   - Guidance: Use `/test <changed files>`.

5. **Tests exist, no review files** → suggest **review**
   - Check: Both source and test changes exist BUT no recent review in `.docs/reviews/` or `.backlog/active/**/quality-round-*.md` (depth-agnostic)
   - Guidance: Use `/audit` to check all changes (code quality + security).

6. **Review done, uncommitted changes** → suggest **commit**
   - Check: Review files exist AND `git status --porcelain` shows uncommitted changes
   - Guidance: Use `/ship` to commit and create PR.

Present the detection result with reasoning, including any ticket directory information from `.backlog/active/`. If the user specified a phase via `$ARGUMENTS`, skip detection and go directly to the guidance for that phase.

### 5. Summary Output

Print a concise summary:
- Current situation (branch, what's been done)
- Active tickets in `.backlog/active/` (list ticket-dir name and available artifacts)
- If `phase_state_records` (from Step 1-pre) is non-empty, also list each record's `{dir} phase={current_phase} last_completed={last_completed_phase} status={overall_status}` — this is the authoritative lifecycle state and takes precedence over compact-state-derived information
- If a YAML-frontmatter compact-state was parsed in Step 1, also list the `active_tickets` recorded at compact time (these are the tickets the user was focused on at the moment of compaction — they may differ from the current `.backlog/active/` listing if filesystem state has drifted)
- Detected phase and recommended next action
- Exact command sequence, e.g.:
  ```
  /clear
  /catchup  (optional, to recover context after clearing)
  /<next-command>
  ```

`/catchup` does NOT emit a `[SW-RESUME]` or `[SW-CHECKPOINT]` block. It is recovery tooling, not a phase terminator — the Summary Output above already states the recommended next command plainly, and `/catchup`-specific tooling should read the "Exact command sequence" line rather than a structured marker. See `skills/create-ticket/references/sw-checkpoint-template.md` for the CHECKPOINT contract and the list of skills that DO emit it.

## Error Handling

- **No artifacts found at all**: Phase detection still works — defaults to suggesting **investigate** as the first step.
- **Researcher agent failure**: Report error but still proceed with phase detection using pre-computed context.
- **Ambiguous state**: Present detection result with reasoning, ask user to confirm or choose differently.
